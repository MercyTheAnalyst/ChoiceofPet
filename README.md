# ChoiceofPet

The project demonstrates problem solving and analytical skills to make the best choice
of pet for a customer.

Susan needs help in choosing a pet btween a dog and a cat. 							
The analysis showed that Susan should go for a cat. This is because in the first year,							
the total cost of of ownership for owning a cat is $559.50 which is lesser when   							
compared to the total cost of ownership for owning a dog that cost $644.00. 							
							
Though, the initial cost of cat of $103.50 appeared to be more costly than the initial 							
cost of dog of $68.00. However, the monthly cost procurred in owning a dog  							
to a cat is far greater. 							
							
It was further visualized using the bar graph that showed $85 difference in the cost  							
of ownership in owning a cat or a dog.							
							
Therefore, I would recommend that Susan choose a Cat as her pet.
